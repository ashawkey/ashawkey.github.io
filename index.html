        <p>
          I was born in Shandong, China. During 2016-2020, I double-majored in Biological Science and Computer Science in Peking University. 
          After that, I joined the Key Laboratory of Perception (MoE) as a Ph.D. student from 2020.

        <p>
          Apart from working, I have broad interests in animes, comics, games and (mainly sci-fi) novels.
          
          I have finished both <i>Divinity: Original Sin</i> 1 and 2 in tactician mode.
          My favorite book series are <i>Tales of Tarsylia</i>.
